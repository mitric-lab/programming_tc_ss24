# Preface

Dear Students,

Welcome to the programming course in theoretical chemistry.
This class builds on the bachelor lecture 
"Programming Course for Chemists" and assumes that you are already
familiar with the basic principles of Python and the numerical 
algorithms explained there. 

According to the current planning, the lecture will be held in
the form of a practical course. This means that the lecturer will
announce a topic and explain the theoretical background.
Afterwards, you will have to study the topic in more detail
yourself with the help of this lecture note and solve the
problem set that is associated with the topic until a given
deadline. During the time solving the problem set, the lecturer
will be available for questions and help.
We will then find a date when some of you will present 
their solutions to the class.

The topic announcement and the discussion will take place on
- Mondays 10:15&ndash;11:45 
or
- Thursdays 12:15&ndash;13:45

in the seminar room 03.013 in building 42 (Theoretische Chemie),
Campus Nord.

You will be graded based on the quality of your solutions and
your presentation. The final grade will be based on the average
of all problem sets.

## Syllabus 

A preliminary syllabus is shown below. This can and will be continuously 
updated throughout the semester according to the progress of the lecture.
