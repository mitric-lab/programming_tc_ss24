# Fundamentals

In the following sections, we will explain the concept of bitwise
operators after laying the necessary foundations. Our goal is to show
what bitwise operators do and what they can be used for. Afterwards,
we also want to show the possibility and importance of unit tests.
At the end of this chapter you should be able to answer the following 
questions:

- How are numbers represented in the computer?
- What is the difference in the representation between signed and 
  unsigned integers?
- What are bitwise operators? Can you name and explain a few examples?
- What are unit tests? Why are they important?
