## Second Quantisation

Until now, we have represented the state of a quantum system by a function 
and observables by operators. This formalism is called *first quantisation*. 
It is rather intuitive to do so, because we can directly interpret the 
wavefunction as the probability amplitude. However, this formalism has 
several problems:
1. It carrys too much information that makes calculations with 
   many particles unnecessarily complicated.
2. The number of particles must be fixed.
3. Not compatible with relativity.

In this section, we will introduce a new formalism called 
*second quantisation*. It is more abstract, but was made to solve the 
problems listed above. 

```admonish note
The term *second quantisation* is a bit misleading, 
because it is not a quantisation of a classical theory. It is 
just a different way to represent quantum states and operators. 
It is equivalent to the first quantisation formalism.

```admonish note
We will only derive the formalism for fermions, 
but it can be generalized to bosons by replacing the antisyymetric 
operations with symmetric ones.
